# Binnacle Codex Guide

This file is the Codex entrypoint for this repository. `CLAUDE.md` remains the detailed project
history and should be read before architectural work, but this file is the concise operational guide
Codex loads automatically.

## Project Shape

Binnacle is a Signal K webapp: Svelte 5 with runes, Vite, TypeScript, MapLibre GL JS, PMTiles,
Comlink workers, Biome, Vitest, Playwright, and dependency-cruiser.

The architecture is Feature-Sliced Design:

`app -> views -> widgets -> features -> entities -> shared`

Imports flow downward. Sibling slices are imported through their `index.ts` public API only.
Dependency-cruiser enforces the rule.

## Product Rules

- Product name: Binnacle Chartplotter. Spell `chartplotter` as one word.
- Treat all navigation output as advisory. Do not weaken the safety posture in docs or UI.
- Build for a stock Signal K server first. Optional plugins and APIs must detect, degrade, and explain.
- Prefer Signal K server APIs and mature plugins over local-only features. Local-only behavior is a
  fallback, not the primary path, when a server API exists.
- Keep data and persisted config in SI. Convert at the display edge using shared helpers.

## UI Rules

- Read `docs/design-system.md` before building or changing UI.
- Read `docs/building-menu-items.md` before adding or changing menu items, panels, or controls.
- Reuse `src/shared/ui` primitives and `src/styles` utility classes before adding local variants.
- Global CSS stays modular through `src/app.css` imports. Do not rebuild a monolithic stylesheet.
- Hoist duplicate markup or CSS at the second copy.
- Use lucide icons for app chrome when an icon exists.
- Night-red must remain true night-readable: no blue, no bright stray pixels, and alarms still distinct.
- Give every new configuration feature, adjustable panel, or panel that may be offscreen or hidden on
  another display a root-level Command K entry that opens it directly.
- Treat desktop, iPad, and phone as first-class operating modes. Every feature must be designed,
  implemented, and verified for all three, including their respective viewport sizes, orientation,
  input method, safe-area insets, and reachable controls. Do not ship a desktop-only feature with a
  mobile fallback as an afterthought, or a touch-only interaction without an equally supported
  desktop path.

## Implementation Rules

- Construct services in `src/app/App.svelte` and inject them. Do not add global singletons.
- Feature orchestration belongs in `create<Feature>Controller(...)` factories in `*.svelte.ts` modules.
- Reactive dependencies that can change, such as auth tokens and feature flags, are injected as getters.
- Reuse helpers from `$shared/lib`, `$shared/map`, `$shared/geo`, `$shared/signalk`, `$shared/ui`,
  and existing entity stores before creating new helpers.
- Keep overlays idempotent: stable source ids, layer ids, teardown, theme application, and reset paths.
- Register protocols and global browser hooks once at startup, not inside components.

## Writing Rules

- No em dashes in committed text, docs, code comments, commit messages, or PR text.
- Use Oxford commas in lists of three or more.
- Do not use `and` as `&` in human-readable text. Use `&` only where syntax or a proper noun requires it.
- Do not mention AI process, agent passes, or review mechanics in changelogs, commits, PR text, or docs.
- Use American English.

## Commands

- Install: `npm install`
- Dev server: `npm run dev`
- Format: `npm run format`
- Lint: `npm run lint`
- Boundary check: `npm run cruise`
- Dead-code check: `npm run deadcode`
- Type check: `npm run check`
- Unit tests: `npm test`
- Coverage: `npm run test:coverage`
- Build: `npm run build`
- Full gate: `npm run verify`
- E2E smoke, Chromium only: `npm run test:e2e:fast` (the offline/PWA and WebKit specs run in `test:e2e:gate`)
- Release gate: `npm run verify:release`

## Verification

For substantial changes, run the full gate before claiming done:

`npm run verify`

Run `npm run verify:browser` when the app shell, layout, instruments, chart lifecycle, or browser
behavior is touched. The preview server may require approval to bind localhost in sandboxed Codex
sessions.

Browser specs share `e2e/helpers.ts`: `stubVesselsSelf` (the self-vessel document every spec needs
answered), `openMenuItem` (open the app menu and activate one tile, scoped to the launcher so a
label that also names a bar pill cannot match the wrong control), and `expectInsideViewport`. Reach
for those before writing a file-local copy, because a file-local helper is invisible to the other
specs and each one ends up re-rolling it. `scripts/check-package.mjs` cross-checks the projects
`test:e2e:gate` names against `playwright.config.ts`, so a new project cannot fall out of the local
push gate while CI keeps covering it.
For releases, also follow `docs/releasing.md` and obtain explicit approval before tagging or
publishing.

## Lint Rule Exceptions

`biome.json` turns off three accessibility rules for `.svelte` only: `useValidAriaValues`,
`useSemanticElements`, and `noLabelWithoutControl`. Biome's Svelte support is partial (it sees the
script and style blocks, not the template's control flow), and on valid Svelte these three report
false positives: a dynamic ARIA binding, a `role="group"` toolbar, and a label wrapping a child
component's control. They are not waived, they are enforced elsewhere: Svelte's own compiler
warnings surface through `svelte-check`, and `@axe-core/playwright` scans the running app in the E2E
gate. Narrow the override if a rule is ever clean on this codebase; do not widen it.

`noUnusedFunctionParameters` and `noUnusedVariables` are off for `.svelte` for the same reason (a
`{#snippet}` parameter or a prop used only in the template reads as unused to Biome).
`noUnusedLocals` and `noUnusedParameters` in `tsconfig.app.json`, which svelte-check enforces and
which does see template usage, is the real backstop.

## Git Hygiene

- The repo normally works directly on `main`.
- Do not revert user changes unless explicitly asked.
- Keep scratch files in `tmp/`.
- Never force-push from this workspace. A force-push is never acceptable.
- Never push from this workspace unless the user explicitly instructs Codex to push. Permission to
  commit, deploy, publish, or complete a workflow does not imply permission to push.

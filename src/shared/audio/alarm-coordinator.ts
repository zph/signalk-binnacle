// One audible output for every Binnacle-owned alarm tone. Each consumer keeps its own policy (what
// counts as "should sound") and its own GatedAlarm edge detection; this owns which single tone
// reaches the speaker, so independent alarms can never sum at the destination or mask each other.
//
// The priority model: a channel registers with a live rank getter (lower is more urgent), because
// a channel's grade can change while it sounds (the collision escalation is co-equal with MOB
// exactly while it is escalating). The most urgent active channels play; several sharing the top
// rank interleave burst by burst, so MOB and an escalating close-quarters contact both stay
// audible. Lower-priority active channels stay visually present elsewhere and get a single-burst
// audible reminder on a bounded interval. A courtesy channel (arrival) never sounds while any
// safety channel is active. Per-alarm mute and acknowledge decisions stay at the call sites. A
// timed whole-output silence is applied here so every current and future channel obeys it.

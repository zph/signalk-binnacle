# Building a new menu item

This is the operational build guide for adding a menu item, the panel it opens, and the controls
inside it, so a new one is indistinguishable from the shipped ones and does not need its styles
corrected afterward.

Read `docs/design-system.md` once for the why (tokens, themes, the modular CSS architecture, the
full primitive and utility-class reference). This guide is the how: the steps in order, the
reuse-or-rebuild decisions, the pitfalls we keep correcting, and the gate. When this guide and
`design-system.md` overlap they agree; `design-system.md` is the reference, this is the checklist.

"Add a menu item" has two senses, kept separate here:

- A new top-level feature reached from the app menu: a `MenuItem` plus the `SlideOver` panel it
  opens. This is most of the guide.
- A clickable row inside a popover menu: the `.menu-item` utility class. See the row-class table in
  section 5.

---

## 0. The gate (run in this order, every change)

During edits, the fast per-file loop:

1. `npx @biomejs/biome check --write <files>` (format, lint, and organize imports, with autofix)
2. `npm run check` (svelte-check plus the tsgo TypeScript passes)
3. `npx @biomejs/biome ci <files>` (no-write verify, the same engine the commit hook runs)

Then run `npm run verify:commit` before committing. The pre-push hook runs
`npm run verify:browser`, including type checks, coverage, a production build, bundle budgets, and
Chromium E2E without a duplicate build. CI runs `npm run verify:ci` for Chromium, WebKit,
package, and runtime dependency coverage.

Tooling traps, each of which has bitten us:

1. All tools are development dependencies. Use the npm scripts or a package-qualified local binary
   through `npx`. Never depend on a globally installed formatter or linter.
2. Biome `lineWidth` is 100. Wrap to 100.
3. dependency-cruiser `no-cross-feature`: a feature may import another feature ONLY through that
   feature's `index.ts` public barrel, never a deep path. The same holds for shared and entities
   slices, and the layer direction is enforced: `app -> views -> widgets -> features -> entities ->
   shared`, with shared importing nothing above it. Cross-feature data flows through an `entities`
   store, never feature to feature.
4. `noGlobalAssign` fires when a local variable shadows a JS global. We have hit this with `open`
   (window.open), `name` (window.name), and other `window.*` names. The fix is to rename the local,
   never to disable the rule. The Disclosure prop is `expanded`, not `open`, for exactly this reason.
5. svelte-check warns `state_referenced_locally` for `let x = $state(prop)`. When the one-time seed
   is intentional (a freshly mounted form takes a snapshot of a default), silence it with
   `untrack(() => prop)`, as `NameEntry` does. Do not ignore the warning.
6. zsh does NOT word-split an unquoted variable, so a file list in `$FILES` reaches the command as a
   single argument. Pass file lists as explicit arguments or a shell array, never a bare `$FILES`.
7. No `prepare` or `prepack` lifecycle script in `package.json`: it corrupts the App Store
   install-simulation step. Git hooks are opt-in through the non-lifecycle `hooks` script.

---

## 1. Wire the menu item in `app/App.svelte` (all four steps, together)

The menu and bottom bar are data-driven, so these four steps are the whole integration. Doing one or
two leaves a tile that opens nothing, or a panel with no way in.

1. Add a `MenuItem` to the `menuItems` array, in the right intent group. The groups today are
   Chart, Navigate, Safety, Weather, Instruments, and Settings. Groups derive from contiguous item
   order, so a group move means relocating the literal, not only editing its `group` string. Safety
   stays before Weather and Instruments; Settings (Profiles) MUST stay last. Set `id`, `label`, `icon` (a lucide component),
   `group`, `pressed: activePanel === '<id>'`, and `onSelect: () => togglePanel('<id>')`. Add
   `shortLabel` when the label is long (the bottom-bar pill renders `shortLabel ?? label`). Use
   `fixedToBar` only for an app-shell action that must always remain in the bottom toolbar while its
   launcher tile stays available; the Instruments toggle is the reference. Add
   `disabled` plus `disabledLabel` for a transient block, such as a chart still loading. When a
   user-relevant optional provider is absent, keep the item visible with `available: false` plus an
   actionable `unavailableHint`; do not hide it with a conditional spread. Offline charts is the
   canonical example: one entry is always present, and its hint explains how to install, start, or
   sign in to Signal K as an administrator. Radar and Playback follow the same
   availability rule. When discovery has multiple failure states, derive the hint from current state
   so absence, an access refusal, malformed provider data, and a transport failure do not collapse
   into the same message.
   Chart Locker management requests use the browser's Signal K administrator session. Do not attach
   Binnacle's device bearer token to its administrator-gated `/api` routes. Classify 401 and 403
   responses against `/skServer/loginStatus` instead of assuming the browser is signed out.
2. Add the panel id to the `LeftPanel` union type.
3. Add the mount block: `{#if activePanel === '<id>' && <guards>}` wrapping `<div
   class="panel-slot"><YourPanel ... onClose={closePanel} onBack={backToMenu} /></div>`. The guards
   mirror the menu gating.
4. Construct the feature's controller and services in `App.svelte` and pass them down as props.
   Services are never global singletons; they are built here so they are swappable in tests.

Large optional panels should expose a cached dynamic-import loader from the slice's `index.ts` and
mount through an `{#await}` block with loading, failure, and Retry states. Keep the import behind the
public API. Use the shared `LazyPanelState` for a docked panel's loading and failure branches so Back,
Close, Escape, and Retry remain available before its module mounts. Use
`createRetryableLazyUiLoader` to bound a stalled import and clear rejected or timed-out promises so
Retry performs a new import. Reserve the unbounded `createRetryableLazyLoader` for one-shot
registration paths without a recovery action, where a slow import must be allowed to finish instead
of permanently rolling back the feature. Wrap the resolved component in the shared `ErrorBoundary`.
Its fallback must preserve the same contextual Back, Close, Exit, or Done controls as the
import-failure state, plus Retry, so a render or effect failure cannot trap the workflow. Apply the
same boundary to nested lazy charts and dialogs. Core chart and safety chrome stays eagerly loaded.
If a chart marker opens a small lazy panel, warm that panel while the marker is tappable so its first
tap does not start the chunk request.

When a menu destination depends on a matching chart layer, opening the destination must establish the
visible state it needs. Use `togglePanel('<id>', () => setLayerVisible('<layer-id>', true))`, as Find
places does for the Places layer. The panel must still render explicit hidden, loading, empty,
offline, and error states reported by the provider path. Do not infer them all from an empty list.

---

## 2. Build the panel (canonical structure, top to bottom)

A panel is a feature component that renders exactly one `<SlideOver>` and nothing else at the top
level. Inside, in this order:

1. The `SlideOver` open tag: `title`, then a specific `closeLabel` (see the copy rules: never the
   bare default), then `{onClose}` and `{onBack}`, then `bodyFlex` when the body is a stack of
   controls and readouts (the common case). Omit `bodyFlex` only for a continuous accordion list
   that owns its own spacing (LayersPanel), and say why in a comment. Optional: `subtitle`, `footer`,
   `minimize` (the phone collapse, as one `{ collapsed, onToggle }` object), `dock`, `ariaLabel`.
   When a phone workflow needs a chart gesture, pass `minimize`, collapse the panel before enabling
   the gesture, and restore it when the gesture finishes or is canceled. Offline area drawing is the
   canonical example. When `focusTrap` changes at a responsive breakpoint, update the prop on the one
   stable `SlideOver`. Do not branch into duplicate panel shells because that discards scroll, focus,
   and child-local state.
2. Top-of-body notes, before any section: a transient error as `<p class="alert-note"
   role="alert">{error}</p>`, and and a write-gate teach note through the shared
   `WriteAccessNote` when `auth.writeBlocked`, whose message names what is blocked in the panel's
   own words. The vocabulary is fixed: read and write access, approved by the boat's Signal K
   admin, never "token".
3. A one-line teach intro in plain helm voice: `<p class="muted-note">...</p>`.
4. One or more `<section aria-label="...">` blocks, each led by an `<h3 class="caps-label">` heading,
   then its control primitives and readouts. A sub-heading is `<h4 class="caps-label">`.
5. A list of saved records uses `<SavedList>` with a next-step `empty` message. A destructive action
   on a card arms an `<InlineConfirm>` first. When a card needs more than one primary and two secondary
   actions, keep the primary visible and put the rest in `OverflowActions` with plain text labels.
   Its shared anchored surface follows panel scrolling, flips above or below, and clamps to the
   viewport. Do not replace that behavior with card-relative positioning.
6. Live status carries a role: `role="progressbar"` with aria-valuemin/max/now for a determinate
   bar, `role="status"` for a soft advisory, `role="alert"` for a hard error. A determinate bar also
   shows a visible percentage, byte count, or item count and supplies matching `aria-valuetext`.
   Never make a thin, unlabeled track the only progress readout.
7. A server-backed list distinguishes initial loading, refresh with retained rows, true empty, and
   failure. Confirmed writes update local state before a follow-up refresh, late refreshes cannot
   overwrite newer results, and conflicting mutations disable until completion. Tracks and Waypoints
   are the canonical saved-resource examples. A failed modal write must preserve the dialog and its
   entered values.
8. An action that starts navigation or turns incomplete sensor history into guidance requires an
   explicit confirmation and states what data it will use. Retrace track and Navigate to waypoint are
   the canonical examples.
9. A background recorder must explain where unsaved and saved data live, what survives reload, and
   what a destructive action removes. If persistence degrades to memory, surface that state before the
   user leaves the panel. The Tracks guide documents the complete lifecycle pattern.
10. A chart-tap tool uses a visible mode affordance, gives the next gesture in its live strip, validates
    and bounds collected points, and restores chart chrome on exit. Selection must not implicitly
    begin a destructive drag. A nested manipulation mode cancels before the parent tool on Escape,
    chart hit areas meet the 44 px target, and the strip supplies a keyboard-equivalent path.
    Selecting an already-active menu item must not silently erase work. Measure is the canonical
    example.
11. Sensor-derived actions must reject stale inputs at the action boundary, not only gray the button.
    Center, Follow, and Anchor watch are the canonical GPS examples. Readouts derived from stale own
    position must become unavailable instead of keeping frozen range or bearing values.
12. A provider load with automatic cooldown must also offer an explicit retry that bypasses that
    cooldown. Keep already accepted data visible during refresh and after failure. Chart sources,
    Forecast, Tides and currents, Data trends, and Playback are the canonical examples.
13. Bound every externally supplied collection, string, coordinate, and numeric range before it
    reaches reactive state or rendering. This includes server resources, plugin discovery, imported
    files, local persistence, IndexedDB replay, and history-provider rows.
14. Every setting must declare whether it belongs to a portable profile, this device, a Signal K
    resource, safety state, credentials, or disposable cache and draft state. Profiles is the
    canonical example. Active profile settings save automatically, so do not add a separate dirty,
    save, or discard workflow. A button labeled Now changes the current view to the newest loaded
    data; it must not hide a network refresh behind navigation wording.
15. Every `PersistedValue` carrying production state must receive a bounded validator or codec. A
    codec owns legacy migration and lets invalid JSON repair to a safe fallback. Record codecs should
    rebuild a clean literal when unknown fields must not survive. Do not cast parsed browser storage
    directly into reactive state.
16. Device-data deletion must register exact Binnacle storage owners. Never call
    `localStorage.clear()`, delete every origin database or cache, or unregister another Signal K
    webapp's service worker. Block erasure while safety or unsaved navigation state is active, and
    explain that local deletion does not revoke server access or delete server resources.
17. Add every production localStorage key to `src/shared/persistence/storage-keys.ts`. Portable
    settings also need a profile type, bounded validation, a binding-table entry, merge metadata, and
    tests. Device, safety, credential, server-resource, and cache values must not enter the profile
    capture path.

Skeleton:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
import { SlideOver, SavedList, InlineConfirm } from '$shared/ui';
// plus the control primitives this panel needs: UnitField, TextField, LayerToggle, Disclosure, ...

interface Props {
  // feature deps (auth, stores, companionBase, map, units) ...
  onClose: () => void;
  onBack?: () => void;
}
const { /* deps */ onClose, onBack }: Props = $props();

let error = $state<string | null>(null);
</script>

<SlideOver title="Feature name" closeLabel="Close feature name panel" {onClose} {onBack} bodyFlex>
  {#if error !== null}
    <p class="alert-note" role="alert">{error}</p>
  {/if}

  <p class="muted-note">One plain sentence telling the helm what this panel does.</p>

  <section class="panel-section" aria-label="Section name">
    <h3 class="caps-label">Section name</h3>
    <!-- control primitives and readouts -->
  </section>

  <section class="panel-section" aria-label="My records">
    <h3 class="caps-label">My records</h3>
    <SavedList items={[]} empty="No records yet. Tap Add to create one." key={(r) => r.id}>
      {#snippet card(record)}
        <!-- card body; arm an InlineConfirm before any destructive action -->
      {/snippet}
    </SavedList>
  </section>
</SlideOver>
```

---

## 3. Pick the panel shape

Three established shapes. Pick by what the second screen IS, not by size.

1. Single flat panel (alarms, installed charts, profiles). The whole feature is one screen of stacked
   sections. Constant `title`, no sub-view state. This is the default; reach for it first.
2. Landing plus sibling sub-views (RegionsPanel). One feature with several peer destinations that
   each deserve a titled screen (home, build, automatic caching, storage). One `subView` state in the
   parent, a `$derived` `subViewTitle` fed to `SlideOver`, and a cleanup-aware `backToOfflineHome`
   callback that returns to the landing first and clears any active map drawing. Installed charts can
   open as a sibling panel, whose back action returns to this landing. Landing rows are a
   `.subview-link row-interactive` button with a label, a current value, and a trailing chevron. Keep
   orchestration and navigation in the parent, and extract substantial sibling screens into focused
   view components, as RegionsPanel does for storage and automatic caching.
3. Detail drill-in (LayersPanel opening SourceDetail). Selecting one record from a list opens that
   record's detail or editor in the SAME SlideOver. The detail renders `<SubViewHeader title=...
   backLabel="Back to <list>" {onBack} />`, and the parent suppresses its own panel-level back while
   the detail is open (`onBack={detailOpen ? undefined : onBack}`).

There must never be two stacked back controls. Whoever owns the in-body back (the title switch in
shape 2, the SubViewHeader in shape 3) requires the panel-level back to be suppressed for that state.

Sanctioned exception: a full-screen map panel (the weather map) hosts its own header chrome instead
of a SlideOver, because it is a docked mini-map with a layers menu and a conditions sheet rather than
a scrolling body of controls. It still carries a specific back control and close control and follows
the copy, token, and accessibility rules. A new panel uses a SlideOver unless it is a full-screen
map of this kind.

Second sanctioned exception: the instrument dock is a true SPLIT, not an overlay. The shell is a
two-column grid; the dock takes the second column beside a live, narrowed chart, with a 1px
`--border` seam (night-red has no shadows) and an instant toggle (animating the grid track would
resize the map every frame). Under its 900px breakpoint the same panel goes full-screen at
`--z-panel`, below the safety strips, with its own close chrome ("Close instruments, return to
chart"). A full-screen instrument panel and a chart-owned panel never stack: the existing chart
panel keeps ownership when the viewport crosses the breakpoint, while deliberately opening
Instruments closes the other surface. Route a dirty editor, such as a Radar area draft, through its
discard guard before transferring that ownership. Its tile grid fills the dock: rows share the full
height, dense flow backfills holes, and an empty tile is never full width (the layout rules live in
the design system's instruments module entry). Selecting a tile opens an in-dock detail view, and
Customize groups available instruments by category with a Rescan action for dynamic Signal K
instances. That scan unions live instances with concrete paths from the preceding year of registered
history providers within a bounded scan.
Validate those context-free catalog paths with a `vessels.self` values query before displaying them.
Previously seen readings remain selectable, visibly marked in Available and Shown, and identified in
detail until live data arrives. Provider absence or failure must preserve live discovery and explain
the reduced catalog. Dynamic labels lead with the reading and then name the source. Customize must
also disambiguate any repeated catalog label so visible text, checkbox names, and reorder
announcements remain unique without deduplicating legitimate readings. Never copy a stored sample
into a current instrument tile. Do not add further
split panels without a matching product case; overlays stay the default.

Data trends is a normal SlideOver, not another split. Its overview selection is profile-owned and
independent from the instrument dock. It renders zero to eight explicit trend descriptors in saved
order and uses `CustomizeToggle` plus `createReorder` for touch and keyboard editing. Preserve
unavailable saved IDs until the navigator removes them. Opening Data trends must trigger live and
historical discovery without depending on the instrument dock having opened. Retain the eight saved
stream demands and recorder buffers plus one optional focused slot, and release removed demands.
Opening a focused chart from an eligible instrument detail adds that transient slot without changing
the overview. Back restores the same detail and focus, while Close clears the transient context and
returns to the chart.

History loading for Data trends is chart-specific. Batch deduplicated `path:aggregate` requests
within the Signal K History API limit, query each registered provider once per batch, and resolve by
candidate priority followed by provider order. Never merge providers or fallback paths inside one
series. Attribute the chosen provider, path, and reference. Keep accepted data during retry, and
distinguish provider checking, partial failure, total failure, true empty history, session fallback,
and no samples. A stock server gets only the bounded, in-memory session window, and the copy must say
so.

Edit-mode entry (the customize rule): render the `CustomizeToggle` primitive from `$shared/ui`,
one per surface, trailing in the header row, and open the mode with one `.muted-note` line
stating what a tap now does. The visual and aria recipe lives in the design system's Edit modes
entry.

The app menu's toolbar editor also shows the current pinned bar order. Use the shared `createReorder`
controller for pointer and ArrowUp or ArrowDown movement, keep the stored `pinnedActionIds` order as
the source of truth, and include a reset action that restores `DEFAULT_PINNED`. The menu tile grid
still controls membership by tapping tiles in edit mode.

---

## 4. Reuse a primitive, never re-implement

Everything below is exported from `$shared/ui`. The standing rule is to hoist a shape into
`$shared/ui` at the SECOND copy; a third copy is a review failure.

| Need | Reach for | Never |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Top-level slide-in panel | `SlideOver` | a bespoke `<aside>` shell |
| In-panel sub-view back header | `SubViewHeader` | a second panel-level back |
| A list of saved items | `SavedList` (with `empty` and a `card` snippet) | a hand-rolled `<ul>` of cards |
| A labeled text field | `TextField` | a raw `<input type="text">` |
| A numeric setting with a unit | `UnitField` | a raw `<input type="number">` |
| Collect or rename a name | `NameEntry` (seeded with `defaultSaveName`) | `window.prompt` |
| Confirm a destructive or immediate navigation action in a panel | `InlineConfirm` | `window.confirm` |
| Confirm a destructive one-tap strip action | `ConfirmArm` | an unguarded one-tap delete |
| Collapse advanced or optional content | `Disclosure` (prop `expanded`) | a hand-rolled toggle, or the prop name `open` |
| A layer or chart toggle row | `LayerToggle` with `description`; use its row presentation in Layers | a bare checkbox or bespoke toggle row |
| An in-panel "show on chart" control | `ShowOnChartToggle` with `description` | a bespoke toggle button |
| A compact per-card show or hide | `VisibilityToggle` | a re-styled icon button |
| A map-anchored menu or popover | `AnchoredMenu` with `onFocusLeft` | a bespoke backdrop, Escape handler, or focus-out check |
| A toolbar menu with a trigger button | `createMenuFocusMachine` | a bespoke Tab redirect and close-focus protocol |
| Explain why a control is grayed | `UnavailableHint` plus a matching `title` | a `title` alone, silent to assistive tech |
| Focus a freshly revealed control | `focusOnMount` | an ad hoc onMount focus call |
| Arrow-key roving in a small menu | `rovingFocus` | a bespoke keydown index walker |
| Import a text file | `pickTextFile` plus `readErrorMessage` | a hidden `<input type="file">` |
| A dated default save name | `defaultSaveName` | an inline date string |
| Escape-dismiss a bespoke overlay | `registerDismiss` | a private window keydown listener |

Two rules that apply to every list and every toggle row:

- Every `LayerToggle` and `ShowOnChartToggle` sets a plain-language `description`, which becomes the
  hover and focus tooltip (it falls back to the title). A toggleable row with no gloss is a finding.
- `SavedList` owns the list `<ul>`, the card frame, and the `empty` state; the panel owns the `<h3>`
  heading above the list and each card body. Do not pass SavedList a `heading` AND render your own
  `<h3>` for the same list, and do not hand-roll the empty `<p>`.

---

## 5. Pick the right row and section class

Reach for a shared class before writing scoped CSS. The full reference is `design-system.md` sections
5 and 7; this is the decision shortcut.

| You are building | Use | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A clickable row in a popover menu | `.menu-item` | full width, control height, accent-tint on hover |
| Any interactive row that hover-tints and lights via `.is-on` | `.row-interactive` | compose it, add only your content layout; do NOT set its background or border-color or you defeat the shared hover and lit state |
| A landing row that opens a sub-view | `.subview-link` on `.row-interactive` | label, value, trailing chevron (RegionsPanel) |
| An elevated card per item, name over metrics | `.nav-row` (with `.nav-name`, `.nav-metrics`) | the AIS and POI sortable lists; this is a vertical card, not a flat row |
| A flat, hairline-divided list line | `.list-row` | layer rows, pinned rows; no border, no fill |
| A raised bordered card surface | `.card-frame` | add your own layout and padding on top |
| A saved-item card list | `SavedList` (renders the `.saved` family) | not a hand-rolled list |
| A binary or tiny-enum choice | `.segmented` group of `.btn`, one `.is-on` | a lone "Off" button is ambiguous; the pair is self-evident |
| A labeled current-item readout | `<dl class="stat-grid">` | three columns; see the empty-unit rule below |
| An at-a-glance inline stats line | `<dl class="card-stats">` | wrapping, mono `.num` |
| A row of action buttons under a heading | `.panel-controls` | Save, Cancel, New |
| A column section with a heading | `.panel-section` | flex column, `--space-2` gap; do not invent a per-feature name |

`.stat-grid` contract: the `dd` is `display: contents`, so a row with no unit MUST still emit an empty
`<span class="unit"></span>` or the unit column of every following row skews. This is required, not a
crutch.

A section heading is always `<h3 class="caps-label">` (sub-heading `<h4 class="caps-label">`). A bare
`<span class="caps-label">` is for inline mini-labels that are not document headings (a stat `<dt>`, a
status tag, SavedList's own internal heading).

---

## 6. The cascade and collision traps (CSS)

These are the style corrections we keep making. Each has a one-line fix.

1. Global class-name collision leaks properties. A local rule that reuses a global class name for a
   different shape inherits every property the local rule does not override. RegionsPanel named a
   flat landing row `.nav-row`; the global `.nav-row` sets `flex-direction: column`, which the local
   rule did not override, so the row stacked and centered. Fix: give the local shape a DISTINCT name
   (`.subview-link`) and compose `.row-interactive`.
2. A Svelte-scoped rule wins on specificity only for the properties it DECLARES. Any property it
   omits still falls through to a same-name global rule. Declare every property you mean to control.
3. The `hidden` attribute is overridden by `display: flex`. A collapsible body must default to
   `display: none` and reveal with `:not([hidden]) { display: flex }`, as Disclosure does, or
   "hidden" content stays visible and the chevron looks inert.
4. Descending-specificity (Biome `noDescendingSpecificity`): a lower-specificity selector appearing
   after a higher one trips the rule. Order higher-specificity selectors AFTER lower ones, or compose
   `.row-interactive` and scope only your own grid. Reach for a `biome-ignore` only with a written
   justification, as `buttons.css` does for `.segmented .btn` before `.btn`.
5. Use tokens, never a hard-coded px or color. The only sanctioned off-scale literals are the
   hairline tier (0.05 to 0.2 rem) and 0.3, 0.35, 0.4, 0.45, 0.55, and 0.6 rem.

---

## 7. Themes and units

- Read color tokens only, never a raw hex, so a control recolors across day, dusk, and night-red
  automatically.
- Night-red forbids any non-red pixel. Shadows collapse to `none`, so never rely on a shadow alone to
  separate surfaces: a border must also be present. Signal state by brightness, never by hue alone
  (`--alarm` is brighter than `--warning`; `--ok` collapses to a dim red at night).
- A raster overlay cannot recolor, so it routes through `applyRasterTheme` (which desaturates and
  dims it at night), never a CSS filter.
- All values are SI in the store (meters, radians, Kelvin). The two sanctioned exceptions are
  `navigation.position` in decimal degrees and Open-Meteo's preceding-hour precipitation in
  millimeters, read only at the display edge and labeled as an hourly rate. Signal K provider
  precipitation is converted from meters to millimeters at ingestion. Convert all other values only
  at the display edge.
- Follow the server unit preference through the `UnitsStore`, never a panel-local imperial or metric
  toggle and never a locale guess. A unit-bearing field consumes the resolved `UnitsMode` as a prop
  and converts only when rendering.

---

## 8. Copy and voice

The audience is a navigator with minimal chartplotting knowledge, so every panel teaches, glosses,
and guides.

- Open with a teach line: the first child is one plain sentence in `<p class="muted-note">` that says
  what the panel does and how to start ("Press and hold anywhere on the chart to drop a waypoint.").
- Gloss every acronym and jargon term, inline the first time with the acronym in parentheses, or with
  a `title` or `description` tooltip. Established glosses to match the voice of: CPA to "Closest
  pass", TCPA to "Time to closest", MLLW to "mean lower low water (MLLW), the chart's zero", ebb and
  flood to "seaward" and "landward", degrees true to a "Degrees true, measured clockwise from true
  north" tooltip. Never ship a bare ZOC, MPA, AIS, or MLLW with no gloss anywhere on the panel.
- Write guiding empty states with a next step, never a dead "No data": "No X yet. <do Y> to ...".
  Use the `SavedList` `empty` prop rather than a hand-rolled `<p>`.
- Voice: second person, imperative for actions, present tense, short sentences. No marketing tone, no
  exclamation except a true alarm.
- Progress uses the single ellipsis character `…`. **Retry** repeats a failed network or provider
  operation, **Refresh list** manually reloads an already usable collection, and **Rescan** repeats
  local sensor discovery. Do not use these verbs interchangeably.
- Use `.alert-note` with `role="alert"` only for actionable failure or safety state. Write-access
  teaching and optional-capability explanations use `.muted-note`; add `role="status"` only when a
  state change should be announced politely.

House writing rules, mandatory in UI text, labels, commit messages, PR bodies, comments, and docs:

- No em dashes. Use a colon, a comma, or two sentences.
- Oxford comma in every list of three or more.
- The word "and", never the ampersand, in displayed or written text (the ampersand is fine only in
  syntax: URL query separators, HTML entities, code operators, and a real brand like B&G).
- "chartplotter" is one word, always.
- American English (color, behavior, center, gray).
- Never describe the AI or review process in any user-facing or repo-facing writing. Title and
  describe by what changed.

---

## 9. Accessibility

- An `aria-label` on every icon-only control and on each tile or title button, with the inner icon
  `aria-hidden="true"`. A grouping container gets a label too (`role="group" aria-label="Sort
  vessels by"`, `<section aria-label="Active alerts">`).
- The `SlideOver` `closeLabel` is always a specific phrase naming the panel ("Close alarms panel"),
  never the bare default.
- Live regions: `role="status"` for non-error progress, state, and counts; `role="alert"` for an
  error or alarm the navigator must act on now. A class supplies the visual voice and the markup
  supplies the semantics: `.alert-note` pairs with `role="alert"`, `.muted-note` with `role="status"`
  where it updates live.
- Section headings are `<h3 class="caps-label">`. The panel's own title comes from `SlideOver` or
  `SubViewHeader`; do not add a second top-level title.
- Use the shared focus actions in `src/shared/ui/focus.ts` (`focusOnMount`, `rovingFocus`,
  `onKeydownAction`); do not hand-roll focus code. True modals use a native `<dialog>` with
  `showModal()`, which provides browser-native Tab trapping without a manual action.
- A grayed control with a `title` must also carry an `UnavailableHint`, or assistive-technology users
  get no reason. The gloss on a row goes in the `description` prop, not a one-off span.

## 10. Pre-flight checklist

Tick all of these before you commit a new menu item.

- [ ] All four `App.svelte` steps: menu item in the right group (Settings stays last), `LeftPanel`
      union member, mount block with matching guards, and the controller and services constructed and
      passed as props.
- [ ] The panel is one `SlideOver` with a specific `closeLabel`, `bodyFlex` (unless it is an
      accordion), and `onClose` and `onBack`. Responsive focus-trap changes preserve that same shell.
- [ ] A teach line opens the body; sections are `<section aria-label>` with `<h3 class="caps-label">`
      headings.
- [ ] Every control is a shared primitive (section 4), every row and section uses a shared class
      (section 5), and no global class name is reused for a different shape.
- [ ] Every toggle row sets a `description`; every saved list uses `SavedList` with a next-step
      `empty`; every destructive action or immediate navigation handoff arms an `InlineConfirm` or
      `ConfirmArm`.
- [ ] A user-relevant optional provider remains visible through `available` and `unavailableHint`;
      the menu does not conditionally hide the missing capability.
- [ ] Determinate progress has a visible percentage or count plus matching progressbar semantics; a
      phone workflow that needs the chart collapses and restores its panel around the gesture.
- [ ] Tokens only, no hard-coded px or color; reads color tokens so it survives night-red; values
      stored in SI and converted only at the edge through the server unit preference.
- [ ] Copy follows the house writing rules; acronyms are glossed; aria-labels, roles, and headings
      are in place.
- [ ] Every same-purpose control matches the label wording and variant of its siblings on other
      surfaces (the "Customize <object>" rule is the model); a new label pattern for an existing
      job is a review failure.
- [ ] Tiles and rows in one grid stay equal height in every state, including empty and degraded;
      a placeholder occupies the value slot, it never collapses the box.
- [ ] Every text size comes from the type-role table in the design system; no new token-role
      pairing without a design-system edit.
- [ ] The gate is green: `npm run verify` passes. Run `npm run verify:browser` when app-shell,
      layout, map, interaction, or browser behavior changes.

## Settled conventions worth restating

These were inconsistent across panels and are now unified; a new panel follows the settled form:

- One section wrapper: `.panel-section` in `panels.css`. Every panel composes it; do not invent a
  per-feature section name.
- One labeled text field: `TextField`, which supports a live `onInput`, a `focusOnOpen`, an
  `onEnter` submit, and a `large` deck-glove size. There is no hand-rolled "caps-label plus input"
  name field left to copy.
- Layers and charts opens to chart sources, not non-chart overlays. Put server-discovered and
  user-added chart sources in the Charts view, with compact name-button visibility, chart-to-chart
  drag stacking, an inline child-layer disclosure for facet visibility and opacity, and detail
  controls for chart opacity, child layers, type, origin, source, zoom, bounds, and show-bounds when
  available. Keep a disabled caret on chart rows without child layers so the disclosure rail stays
  aligned and the missing capability is explicit. Keep
  non-chart visibility, opacity, management, and drag stacking in the Overlays view.
